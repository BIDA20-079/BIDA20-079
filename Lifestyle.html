        <p>A walk, peddle, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.

            Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its borders, and most of them are free, making it one of the few cheap things to do in NYC.</p>
            

            <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> 2.Rockefeller Center & Top of the Rock Observation Deck</h1>
            <img src="images/rock.jpg" alt="a picture of the rockefeller center" style="height: 40%; width: 60%;">

        <p>
            When it comes to New York attractions, Rockefeller Center is on almost all tourist's itineraries. This vast entertainment and shopping complex in the middle of Manhattan is home to NBC-TV and other media, but the centerpiece is the 70-story 30 Rockefeller Plaza, an Art Deco skyscraper that offers awesome views over Manhattan from the famous Top of the Rock Observation Deck. Skating on the outdoor skating rink at the base of the tower is one of the most popular things to do in winter in New York City and a fun activity for families and couples. The rink is typically open from October to April.
            The "deck," as it's known, includes three floors, located on the 67th, 69th, and 70th floors. Indoor and outdoor viewing spaces offer spectacular views by day or night. You can buy a Top of the Rock Observation Deck Ticket in advance. These tickets come with a flexible voucher redemption policy, so you can change the date if your plans change or the weather doesn't cooperate.

         <h2>Transpotation</h2>
         <img src="images/transport.jpg" alt=" a picture of car traffic in NYC" style="height: 10%; width: 30%;">

        <P>
            In NYC, buildings could almost be considered the “easy part” in the fight for a cleaner Earth. Transportation makes up for approximately one-third of New York’s overall emissions.3 While New York already has a low car ownership rate thanks to efficient public transportation methods, New York’s infamous traffic patterns prove car culture is still alive and well in the city. The Mayor’s Office of Sustainability states that 83% of emissions from transportation come from private vehicles.4 In response, the city is encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles by making electric vehicle fast-charging stations easily accessible throughout NYC.

        <h1>Water quality</h1>
        <img src="images/water quality.jpg" alt="a picture showing water quality" style="height: 25%; width: 30%;">

       <P>
        PFOA and PFOS are chemicals commonly found in everyday items like fast food wrappers, cosmetics, nonstick cookware, and more. But, did you know it’s also in New York’s drinking water? While New York is moving toward regulations that would lower the concentration of chemicals found in the water, it’s not entirely removing the threat. As a result, millions of New Yorkers will remain vulnerable to the harmful effects of these chemicals. The public is being encouraged to write Commissioner Zucker and demand the PFOA and PFOS standard for drinking water be brought down to the lowest possible level of two parts per trillion.5

       <h1>Food waste</h1>
        <img src="images/food waste.jpg" alt="a picture showing wasted food" style="height: 40%; width: 60%;">

       <P>
        The Mayor’s office reports that New York City sends approximately 1.3 million tons of food waste to the landfill every year.6 Furthermore, degrading food waste produces a harmful greenhouse gas called methane. Tossing food in a landfill not only harms the environment but takes away the opportunity to harness compost as another clean energy source. Restaurants are the primary culprit of food waste, and the Mayor has issued a challenge to them to encourage organic material recycling. Individuals can do their part by composting in their homes and supporting restaurants that taking their role in sustainability seriously.
