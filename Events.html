            <h2>1.New York World’s Fair of 1939-1940</h2>
            <img src="images/past events.jpg" alt="a picture showing new york worlds fair event" style="height: 30%; width: 50%;">
        <p>Early world’s fairs focus extensively on industrialization, and they showed the importance of scientific advances and technology. This, however, changed when the World’s Fair was hosted in New York City from 1939 to 1940, where the theme was “Dawn of a New Day.” Countries from around the world participated in it, and the fair attracted about 44 million people. Unlike earlier world’s fairs, the 1939-40 New York World’s Fair focused on culture and society rather than technology. One exhibit was a time capsule that included a Mickey Mouse Watch, cigarettes, and writings by Einstein.</p>
       
        <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> 2.Constructing the Brooklyn Bridge</h1>
        <img src="images/past events 2.jpg" alt=" a picture showing construction of brooklyn bridge" style="height: 30%; width: 50%;">

    <p>
        John Augustus Roebling started building the Brooklyn Bridge in 1869. John soon fell sick and handed over his project to his son, Washington Roebling. In 1870, Washington got physically injured and passed on the project to his wife, Emily Warren Roebling. The lady worked day and night with her husband and the construction crew until Brooklyn Bridge became a reality in 1883. It was the largest suspension bridge of its times, but people gossiped about its weakness and shallowness. P.T Barnum marched with 21 elephants across the bridge to test its strength and got his answer. Today, Brooklyn Bridge stands tall and keeps attracting tourists.

    <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> 3.The New York Post & End of Slavery</h1>

<p>
    New York Post was previously known as the New York Evening Post. It was established by Alexander Hamilton, country’s first secretary of treasury, in 1801. He created this publication to highlight the principles of American constitution and their application.  New York put a formal end to slavery in 1827, as more New Yorkers became part of the anti-slavery movement. Countless events of torture and hardship brought this day, but the announcement caused more riots. New York once again saw some gruesome events as angry mobs raided homes and raised hue and cry. This war ended in 1863 after some formal steps by the government.

        <h2>1.Green borders </h2>
        <h3>Raised green waterfronts mitigate flooding and sea-level rise.</h3>
        <p>Earlier this year, the city released projections that local sea levels would rise between four and eleven inches by the 2020s. As a result, by 2050 “there may be a band of green space wherever the most vulnerable flood zones are,” said Arup civil engineer Vincent Lee. “Waterfront parks and wetlands will give back the land to Mother Nature. It’s a tough challenge, because we are regenerating our waterfront to meet the housing demands we have in NYC. In the future, any buildings and infrastructure within the most vulnerable areas will need to be resilient to live with water. But the majority of the waterfront can be reimagined and raised to provide multiple uses, restore the ecology, and be a means for flood protection.”

        <h2>2.Digital democracy</h2>
        <p>
            “Facilitating digital voting is aimed at getting people more involved with the formal elements of the city, and, in doing so, diluting the influence of minority power groups within the democratic system,” said Tom Wilcock.

            New Yorkers vote less than their counterparts in other large American cities. Turnout has been falling for decades, reaching a historical low during the November 2013 mayoral election. Improving the city’s built environment and making it more responsive to citizen needs will require more and better political engagement. As digital literacy becomes ubiquitous and the Internet becomes more deeply entwined with every aspect of our lives (and bodies?), digital voting and other kinds of computationally mediated government–citizen exchanges will seem increasingly natural.

        <h2>3.No gas, no oil No more fossil fuels — all buildings run on renewably generated electricity.</h2>
        <p>
            A recent study published in the journal Energy Policy determined that it would be theoretically possible to power New York State solely with renewable energy by 2030. (By contrast, 24% of the state’s energy came from renewables in 2011.)

New York City and State are both moving to wean themselves off fossil fuels — and, for the sake of the planet, must continue to do so. A promising recent step: Mayor Bloomberg’s announcement of the development of the city’s largest solar energy project, projected to increase its renewable energy capacity by 50%.
        </p>
        <h2>4.(Auto)nomous only Autonomous electric taxis provide clean, efficient transportation throughout the city; private passenger vehicles are banned.</h2>
        <P>
            Autonomous electric vehicles hold the potential to dramatically reshape car travel. Substituting artificial for human intelligence should keep people safer; “Human error is behind almost 100% of car crashes,” as researcher Dr. Ralf Herrtwich told the Wall Street Journal. The cars could be significantly cheaper to operate due to the elimination of labor (i.e., driver), fuel, and maintenance costs (electric motors require far less upkeep than their internal combustion counterparts). Emissions would disappear, improving public health. Children, the elderly, and the disabled would have greater mobility. Traffic congestion would fall due to the vehicles’ ability to travel close together and find the most efficient routes.

Can all this come to pass by 2050? Arup transport planner William Baumgardner thinks so. “There’s a lot of debate about when we’ll reach what’s called full level-4 autonomy, which is when the human is no longer the backup system. Twenty-five to thirty-five years out is pretty much the back end of that range. So I think it’s safe to say that vehicles will be able to operate fully autonomously by then.”
